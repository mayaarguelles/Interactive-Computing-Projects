            </h1>
            <p>
                Alone is a simple / not-so-simple maze game that gets increasingly difficult as time goes on. The aim is simple: guide the ghost to the treasure with the WASD keys. The means, however, are not always as simple.

            <p>
                Each level is populated with a random set of invisible walls that will hinder your ghost's progress towards the treasure. Every time you collect a treasure chest, the chance of a wall generating increases. So, it becomes half a game of memory and have a game of literally stumbling in the dark looking for possible routes to the treasure.

                If you'res struggling and need some help, there is a cheat mode that you can enable by entering the Konami code in game, that's: &uarr; &uarr; &darr; &darr; &larr; &rarr; &larr; &rarr; A B + ENTER

                I didn't have any specific inspirations for this game, I just wanted to experiment with tile-based collision systems. It could probably be more optimized so that every tile is not always getting checked for collision, just the ones centered around the character, but c'est la vie.
