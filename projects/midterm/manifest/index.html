            <p>
                For my midterm project, I want to create a farming simulator inspired by games like Harvest Moon, or Stardew Valley. 
            </p>

                Personally, I am not a huge fan of intense or high speed action focused games. When I play a video game, I want to relax, not compete. The first games I played and enjoyed as a kid were all sort of in this vein, like Harvest Moon, or Animal Crossing. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I also want the game to actively discourage 'gaming the system', so to speak. To discourage the industrialization of a farm, or speed runs, I want to add behavior that encourages a personal engagement / depth of interaction with the farm over large scale projects. So no autonomous watering systems, maybe even incorporating elements of the real world drawbacks of industrialization, like making plots of land have limited nutrients, encouraging crop rotation, so that players can't just plant boatloads of whatever a season's cash crop / cow is.
            </p>

            <p>
                I also want to explore this depth of play over breadth in the features themselves. Newer installments of the Harvest Moon series, or even revivals like Stardew Valley have focused on expanding the capabilities of the base 'farming' aspect of the farming simulator: procedurally generated dungeons, terraforming, minigames, etc. The farming becomes a means to an end: you farm to get money so you can kill things / buy things / somehow do other things. While I do want there to be rewards involved in the farming system, I want to recenter the farming itself.
            </p>
            <figure class="alignright">

            </figure>
            <p>
                So, I want to limit the play to essentially almost all farming, maybe some features of ranching or fishing, but I want it to be more vertically oriented rather than horizontal. When a game is packed with so many features, it feels more flat, despite there being technically more things to do. I think there's something magical about even a bare bones game like the early Harvest Moon installments, or the emptiness of an early Animal Crossing town compared to its current installments. It makes your connection to the experience even more personal, because largely you have to project your own experience onto the game.
