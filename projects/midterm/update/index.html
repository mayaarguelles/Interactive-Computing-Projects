                So far I've gotten the main logic of the game up and running -- all that seems left to do is to skin the tileset, add a little more variation to the structure I've outlined (crop species, varying lengths of growth...) and actually create the maps!

                    A wonderfully vivid and visually stimulating look at the game.

                Essentially what is represented above are some arbitrary decorative tiles -- each tile here appears just as its ID, and some crops! Tiles 10-19 are crops, where 10-14 represent different stages of unwatered crops, and 15-19 represent those same stages, but the watered states. Every day change, the crops are checked to see if they are watered, and if they are their growth counter is incremented / maybe they reach the next stage of growth. If they are unwatered, there is a chance they die overnight.
            </p>

                I still need to add the inventory functionality / functionality to handle what happens <i>after</i> you grow something -- selling, buying seeds, etc. Also, hopefully I can get the crop interaction where you can use the p5 speech to text feature to speak to your plants up and running. I have a skeleton of the interaction set out, and have created a <a href="../speech-interpretation/">test run</a> for querying an API that determines if a string is positive, negative, or neutral.
            </p>

                If you'd like to see what else is going on under the hood, the project is <a href="https://github.com/mayaarguelles/Interactive-Computing-Projects">also up on GitHub</a> under the midterm branch.
