                AR Tamagotchi
            </h1>
            <p>
                For my final project, I want to use AR to create a modular / customizable tamagotchi-like system. In the physical world, the tamagotchi will be some sort of vessel with a feducial marker that allows it to be tracked / have a face projected onto the vessel with AR.
            </p>
            <figure class="alignright">
                <img src="img/default.gif" alt="Tamagotchi angel">
                <figcaption>A dead tamagotchi</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                As for the modularity, my idea was that the feducial marker was actually just a frame, and the vessel had points where accessories could be inserted to either interact or customize the virtual pet -- so you could add a certain accessory to the physical controller, which modifies the literal, physical appearance of the of the controller, while also sliding a new element into the feducial marker's frame, which could then be read and used to alter the behavior of the virtual pet.
            </p>
            <figure class="alignright">
                <img src="img/hqdefault.jpg" alt="Pixel chix">
                <figcaption>Pixel chix</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Then, depending on the work needed to create a system of modular feducial markers distinct enough to be able to tell the difference between unique combinations of accessories, it would be cool to somehow be able to make the pets communicate with each other. This may be complicated with one screen, as (at least to me) it seems like it would be difficult to maintain identities of modular / changing feducial markers when more than one marker is appearing on the screen -- but if two users both viewing their own pets could interact with each other somehow, it would be interesting to see how that could be developed.
